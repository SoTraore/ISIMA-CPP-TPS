## Main goal of this exercices
When there is a lagacy relationship between two classes when a method of the most specialized 
class is been called it will use first the specialized class method if it exist otherwhise it use the parent class's one.

## Agregation relation
An agregation occurs when an object is composed of other objects and it destruction doesn't entail the destructtion of its
components.
So the child / specialized class can exist without the parent class.

## Terminating a program
- return 0; // fin naturelle (par d√©faut)
- std::exit()
- std::terminate()
- std::unexpected()(on ne devrait jamais l'appeler)
